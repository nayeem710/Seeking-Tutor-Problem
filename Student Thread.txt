Hello, As-salamu-alaykum ma’am. I’m.........
In our project, we initialized total 3 threads, students, tutors, and coordinator.
I will describe the student thread.
According to our project, the student will start working first. In this part the student
will start programming first, then the student can come to the waiting area. When a student
comes to the waiting area and if he doesn’t get any seat then he will go back to programming.
But if it gets a seat, we will increment the occupied chairs by 1 and the request number of that
student will be incremented too and the request number will be stored in a visited array in that 
student’s corresponding position.
If the student has taken their maximum limit of help, then the student increment finished student no variable to keep 
the track of how many students have done, 
and then the student will send a signal to the coordinate and wait to be tutored. After getting maximum 
help from the tutor then the student thread can be terminated.

Now the next coordinate thread will describe my teammate.....
Thank you ma'am.
