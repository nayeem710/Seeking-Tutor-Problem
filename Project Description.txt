We have a club where undergraduate students get help with their programming assignments from tutors.
The club has a coordinator and several tutors to assist the students. Here, students can come to the
waiting area, if there is no available seat then they will go back to programming. Otherwise, they will
wait in the waiting area. The coordinator will then prioritize students in a queue. Then tutor will find
the student from the queue who has the highest priority and tutor them. If more than one student has the
same priority the tutor will choose who came first. After getting the maximum amount of help students terminate.
When all students will be finished getting help, the tutor will terminate and then the coordinator will be terminated
