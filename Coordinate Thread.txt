Hello, As-salamu-alaykum ma’am. I’m ..........
I will describe the coordinate thread.
In the coordinator thread, it was waiting for the student threads signal.
The coordinator waits for students to come to seek help. After getting the signal,
if the student number has visited, then the coordinator prioritizes students according to their priority.
If many students’ priority is the same, then the coordinator prioritizes them according to who has come first.
Then coordinator sends a signal to the tutor and assigns them to the tutor.
Now the next tutor thread will describe my teammate………
