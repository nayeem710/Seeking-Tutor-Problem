Hello, As-salamu-alaykum ma’am. I’m .....
I will describe the tutor thread.
In the tutor thread, it was waiting for the coordinator signal.
The tutor will find the student with the highest priority.
If multiple students have the same priority, it will find the student 
who came first. Here we are basically trying to find the minimum request
number. Then the tutor will send that particular student signal to stop waiting.
Back to the student, it will get the signal from the tutor and then the priority 
will increment by one and goes back to programming. After the coordinator finds that
all students have finished, it will notify the tutor to execute.
When the tutor finds that all students are done, the tutor will terminate, and when all 
the tutor terminates, the coordinator terminates finally.

Now my teammate Md. Jannatul Haq will run the code and will show the output.
